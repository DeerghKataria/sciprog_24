# Week 4 Practical
This repository contains one C program for Week 4 practical exercises: `Prac4.c`. The program demonstrates the use of the trapezoidal rule to approximate the area under a curve (specifically the tangent function), using numerical integration.

## Files Included:
`Prac4.c` - A program that computes the approximate area under the tangent curve from 0 to 60 degrees using the trapezoidal rule. It also compares the result with the actual value of the integral, `ln(2)`.
