# Week 3 Practical
This repository contains one C program for Week 3 practical exercises: `trap.c` and `useprintf.c`.

## Files Included:
`trap.c` - A program to compute the trapezoidal approximation for the integral of the tangent function over a given interval and compare the result with the logarithmic function. <br/>
`useprintf.c` - A program to shows the difference between float and integers and difference in the precision value of floating point variable.

## To Run:
```bash
gcc trap.c -o trap -lm
./trap

gcc useprintf.c -o useprint
./useprint
```
