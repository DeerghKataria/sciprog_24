# Week 3 Practical
This repository contains one C program for Week 3 practical exercises: `trap.c`. The program demonstrates numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule, as well as computing absolute and relative differences between results.

## Files Included:
`trap.c` - A program to compute the trapezoidal approximation for the integral of the tangent function over a given interval and compare the result with the logarithmic function.
