# Week 2 Practical
- This repository contains two C programs for Week 2 practical exercises: conversion.c and sum.c. Each program demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts like loops, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and floating-point precision.

## Files Included:
`conversion.c` - A program to convert an integer to its binary representation and calculate the number of binary digits.
`sum.c` - A program that computes the sum of the harmonic series in two different ways and compares the difference between the results.
