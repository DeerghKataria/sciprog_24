# Week 2 Practical
This repository contains two C programs for Week 2 practical exercises: `conversion.c` and `sum.c`.

## Files Included:
`conversion.c` - A program to convert an integer to its binary representation and calculate the number of binary digits. <br\>
`sum.c` - A program that computes the sum of the harmonic series in two different ways and compares the difference between the results.

## To Run:
```bash
gcc conversion.c -o conversion -lm
./conversion

gcc sum.c -o sum
./sum
```
